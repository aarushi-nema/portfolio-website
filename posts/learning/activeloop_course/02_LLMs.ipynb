    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "- Understand what LLMs are and how they work\n",
    "- Learn about LLM architecture and components\n",
    "- Explore token limitations and context size management\n",
    "- Understand the relationship between LLMs and LangChain\n",
    "- Learn about prompting vs finetuning approaches"

    "\n",
    "To find the maximum number of tokens for the OpenAI model, refer to the max_tokensCopy attribute. For example, if youâ€™re using the GPT-3Copy model, the maximum number of tokens supported by the model is 2,049. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to ensure that the input text does not exceed the maximum number of tokens supported by the model, as this may result in truncation or errors during processing. To handle this, you can split the input text into smaller chunks and process them separately, making sure that each chunk is within the allowed token limit. You can then combine the results as needed."
