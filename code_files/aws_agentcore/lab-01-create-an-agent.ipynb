    "## Lab 1: Creating a simple customer support agent prototype\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "[Amazon Bedrock AgentCore](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/agentcore/) helps you deploying and operating AI agents securely at scale - using any framework and model. It provides you with the capability to move from prototype to production faster. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this 5-labs tutorial, we will demonstrate the end-to-end journey from prototype to production using a **Customer Support Agent**. For this example we will use [Strands Agents](https://strandsagents.com/latest/), a simple-to-use, code-first framework for building agents and the Anthropic Claude Sonnet 3.7 model from Amazon Bedrock. For your application you can use the framework and model of your choice. It's important to note that the concepts covered here can be applied using other frameworks and models as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Workshop Journey:**\n",
    "- **Lab 1 (Current)**: Create Agent Prototype - Build a functional customer support agent\n",
    "- **Lab 2**: Enhance with Memory - Add conversation context and personalization\n",
    "- **Lab 3**: Scale with Gateway & Identity - Share tools across agents securely\n",
    "- **Lab 4**: Deploy to Production - Use AgentCore Runtime with observability\n",
    "- **Lab 5**: Build User Interface - Create a customer-facing application\n",
    "\n",
    "In this first lab, we'll build a Customer Support Agent prototype that will evolve throughout the workshop into a production-ready system serving multiple customers with persistent memory, shared tools, and full observability. Our agent will have the following local tools available:\n",
    "- **get_return_policy()** - Get return policy for specific products\n",
    "- **get_product_info()** - Get product information\n",
    "- **web_search()** - Search the web for troubleshooting help\n",
    "- **get_technical_support()** - Search a Bedrock Knowledge Base\n",
    "\n",

      "### Initial Power Troubleshooting Steps:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Check Power Cable Connections**\n",
      "   - Ensure the power adapter is firmly connected to both your laptop and the wall outlet\n",
      "   - Look for any visible damage to the cable (fraying, bent pins, etc.)\n",
      "   - Check that the connection point on the laptop isn't loose or damaged\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Verify Power Outlet Functionality**\n",
      "   - Try plugging another device into the same outlet to confirm it's working\n",
      "   - Try a different power outlet to rule out electrical issues\n",
      "   - If using a power strip or surge protector, try bypassing it and plugging directly into the wall\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Try a Different Power Cable if Available**\n",
      "   - If you have access to another compatible power adapter, see if that resolves the issue\n",
      "   - This can help determine if the problem is with the adapter rather than the laptop\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Check for Physical Damage**\n",
      "   - Inspect your laptop for any signs of physical damage\n",
      "   - Look for liquid damage indicators if applicable\n",
      "\n",
      "### Additional Troubleshooting Steps:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Battery Reset**\n",
      "   - If your laptop has a removable battery, remove it and the power cable\n",
      "   - Hold the power button for 30 seconds to discharge any residual power\n",
      "   - Reconnect the battery and power cable, then try turning it on again\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Check for Signs of Life**\n",
      "   - Look for any LED indicators that might light up when connected to power\n",
      "   - Listen for fan noise or hard drive spinning\n",
      "   - Check if the caps lock or num lock keys respond with their indicator lights\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **External Display Test**\n",
      "   - Connect your laptop to an external monitor to see if it's just a display issue\n",
      "   - If the external monitor works, your laptop is powering on but has a screen issue\n",
      "\n",
      "If none of these steps resolve the issue, your laptop might have a more serious hardware problem such as a failed motherboard, power supply, or other internal component that would require professional service.\n",

      "   - Install any available updates as they often include thermal management improvements\n",
      "\n",

      "   - Disable Background App Refresh (Settings > General > Background App Refresh)\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Remove Case Temporarily**\n",
      "   - Some cases can trap heat; try using your iPhone without its case to see if it helps\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Avoid Direct Sunlight and Hot Environments**\n",
      "   - Keep your iPhone away from heat sources and direct sunlight\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Check for Problematic Apps**\n",
      "   - Go to Settings > Battery to see which apps use the most power\n",
